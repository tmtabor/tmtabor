<p>Cebu has been described as the land that time forgot. It is one of the last refuges of the 
ogres. It is a primal land, filled with mega-fauna and hunter-gatherers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Cebu has long been isolated from mainland Trystell, both
culturally and geographically. Because of this distance it is
something of a throwback—a land that time forgot. Not only is
it the last refuge of the ogres, but it is also home to an
impressive array of mega-fauna.</p>
<p>Sometime in the centuries after the War of the Shattering the
ancestors of the island's ogres established
their tribal culture. Here they found the island uninhabited, and
started to rebuild their culture as they saw fit. They fashioned a
culture centered around the tribe, where magic was taboo and
where status came with hunting the great game of the island.
In later times the island would be subject to several gnomish
migrations and a later crusade by Grichom to drive heretics from,
the region. These latter invaders built on the island a colony with
a working port. This one city on the island, however, has long
since fallen under the shadow of the surrounding gnomish tribes.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Most of Cebu still retains a hunter-gatherer culture, barely in the
bronze age. Tribal loyalties on the island run strong, and the
native ogres, gnomes and humans/dragonborn tend to stick with
their own.</p>
<p>Magic has a particularly strong taboo among the tribes on the island, and
among some tribes “witches” are killed upon discovery, their
heads left on pikes as a warning to others.
Cebu is also one of the few regions on Trystell where the
Common language hasn't penetrated far from Lalog colony.</p>
<h2>Major Region Features</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gimbi Forest:</strong> Gimbi Forest is made up mostly of an
extremely large species of elm trees that only grow on Cebu
Island. This species of trees is known for its high-quality, waterresistant
wood and is often sought in ship construction by those
who have large sums of money.
The locals make sure not to cut
down too many trees. If they did, it
would not only destroy the trees,
but it would drive down prices.</li>
<li><strong>Gimloo:</strong>
Gimloo is a tribal camp whose
economy is centered around
extraction of natural resources.
Logging goes on in the south,
mining in the west. These resources
are then typically shipped
downriver to Lalog where they
make their way by port to the far
corners of Trystell.</li>
<li><strong>Lagden Mountains:</strong> The Lagden Mountains are a small
mountain chain on Cebu. This chain is rich in a variety of
different ores and home to many different dangerous, but
valuable, species whose hides fetch a sizable price elsewhere.
The peaks are capped in glaciers.</li>
<li><strong>Lagden River:</strong> The Lagden River is a surprisingly sizable
river, despite being on an island. It is fed by the glaciers that sit
high in the Lagden Mountains and is it is said that its water
possesses restorative properties.</li>
<li><strong>Lalog:</strong> The lone settled colony on Cebu, Lalog was
founded during a Grichom-funded crusade to the island
a generation ago. Today, however, the city is under the rule of the
much-feared gnomish Wrathwrench clan. They demand tribute from the city
and take a cut of all goods being shipped through the port..</li>
<li><strong>Nirifte:</strong> This large encampment exists
mostly as a trading grounds for hunters and trappers, although it
seasonally becomes the nexus and meeting point for the various
tribes found across western Cebu. It also serves as the largest
fishing encampment on the island, and during the appropriate
season boats will regularly travel between here and Lalog.</li>
<li><strong>Ruby Mountain:</strong> Ruby Mountain is one of the fabled gem
mountains. It is a sacred place to the followers of Zuraic and guarded 
by a strange lizard creature. However,
there have been strange rumors of this mountain slowly
crumbling; something not occurring on the other gem mountains.</li>
