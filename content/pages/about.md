I am a software engineer at the [Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](http://www.broadinstitute.org/) 
and currently a visiting scholar at the [University of California, San Diego](http://som.ucsd.edu/).
I work on various open source bioinformatic tools.

In my professional life, I am the principal developer of [GenePattern Notebook](http://genepattern-notebook.org) 
and also write code for the [GenePattern](http://genepattern.org) server. Additionally, I 
have worked on [GenomeSpace](http://genomespace.org) and the [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) 
integration of [Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)](http://igv.org). I primarily program in 
Python, JavaScript and Java, but have experience with a variety of other languages as well.

In my spare time, I write and design tabletop games, mostly of the roleplaying variety. These are published by 
[Tab Creations LLC](http://www.tabcreations.com), of which I am part-owner. Games I have written, crowdfunded and 
published include [Shadows Over Sol](http://www.tabcreations.com/site/Shadows_Over_Sol), 
[Against the Dark Yogi](http://www.tabcreations.com/site/Against_the_Dark_Yogi) and the upcoming 
[Dime Adventures](http://www.tabcreations.com/signup/4/). I have seen evidence of my games being played on four continents.

I was chairman of the 2015 [Festival of the LARPs](http://2015.festivalofthelarps.com/) convention, and in the 
past I have worked with the board of [New England Interactive Literature](http://www.interactiveliterature.org/NEIL/), 
helping organize their annual [Intercon](http://www.interactiveliterature.org/NEIL/interconConventions.html) convention.
