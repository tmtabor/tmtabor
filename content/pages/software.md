I maintain or have contributed to the following pieces of open source software. For a list 
of additional projects for which I have contributed, please see my 
[GitHub profile](https://github.com/tmtabor).

**[GenePattern Notebook](http://genepattern-notebook.org)** is an extension for Jupyter 
Notebook which bridges the functionality of Jupyter and GenePattern. It provides access 
to hundreds of bioinformatic tools within Jupyter Notebook, all within a friendly user 
interface.

**[Notebook Repository](https://github.com/genepattern/notebook-repository)** is a 
web service intended to run alongside a JupyterHub instance. It integrates with the
JupyterHub authenticator API, providing notebook publication and sharing functionality 
within the proxied Jupyter Notebook instances.

**[GenePattern Server](http://genepattern.org)** is a platform for bioinformatic research 
that wraps hundreds of analytic tools for the analysis of gene expression (RNA-seq and 
microarray), sequence variation and copy number, proteomic, flow cytometry and network 
analysis. It also provides a REST API and queueing system integrations.

**[GenePattern Python Library](https://github.com/genepattern/genepattern-python)** is a 
Python wrapper for the GenePattern API. It provides programmatic access for searching and 
selecting analysess, uploading files, submitting jobs, retrieving the analysis results and 
sending those results to a downstream step in an analysis pipeline.

**[Jupyter WYSIWYG Editor](https://github.com/genepattern/jupyter-wysiwyg)** is an 
extension for Jupyter Notebook that adds WYSIWYG editing functionality to markdown/HTML 
cells. It does this by integrating the popular CKEditor.

**[GenomeSpace](http://genomespace.org/)** is a cloud-based interoperability framework, 
bridging the gaps between a diverse set of popular bioinformatic tools. This makes it 
possible to frictionlessly use the available analyses and visualizations in each tool with 
others in the GenomeSpace ecosystem.

**[IGV.js Jupyter](https://github.com/igvteam/igv.js-jupyter)** is a Python wrapper and 
nbextension for the JavaScript version of Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV.js), allowing 
the popular genomic visualization tool to be easily configured and embedded inside the 
Jupyter Notebook environment.

**[Django Simple Ticket](https://github.com/tmtabor/django-simpleticket)** is a simple 
ticket-tracking app that can easily be dropped into a new or existing Django site. It aims 
for bare bones simplicity rather than elaborate features, minimizing dependencies and 
allowing the app to be set up in as little time as possible.
