* **Dime Adventures: Pulp Alternate History Roleplaying**<br/>
*Writing, Design, Crowdfunding, Layout and Team Coordination, January 2017*
    * A pulp roleplaying game set in an alternate history of the year 1904. This game has 
    been written and developed, but is currently waiting for its crowdfunding and 
    subsequent publication. This is scheduled for January 2017.
    
* **Tab Creations Roleplaying Game Adventure Patreon**<br/>
*Writing, Design, Crowdfunding, Layout and Team Coordination, March 2016*
    * An ongoing project to crowdfund the development of roleplaying game adventures and 
    supplements for *Shadows Over Sol*, *Against the Dark Yogi* and other associated games.

* **Shadows Over Sol: Science Fiction Horror Roleplaying**<br/>
*Writing, Design, Crowdfunding, Layout and Team Coordination, September 2015*
    * A science fiction horror roleplaying game set in our own solar system, some 200 
    years in the future. Humanity has spread throughout the inner planets and is making 
    headway into the outer solar system, but humankind has brought its own dark workings 
    with it into space.
    
* **We're All Going to Die Here: A Tongue-in-Cheek Horror Card Game**<br/>
*Writing, Design, Crowdfunding, Layout and Team Coordination, October 2014*
    * A tongue-in-cheek card game based on the tropes of the horror genre. In it a group 
    of teenagers explore a haunted mansion, only to be picked off one by one in overly 
    cliche ways. Those players whose characters are eliminated then "join the haunt," 
    working to make the game harder for the remaining players.
    
* **Against the Dark Yogi: Mythic India Roleplaying**<br/>
*Writing, Design, Crowdfunding, Layout and Team Coordination, February 2014*
    * A tabletop roleplaying game set in a fantasy world based on mythological India. It's 
    a game of high action and cosmically-chosen heroes with fantastic abilities, working 
    to thwart the coming of the final age of the world.

* **Saga Machine: A Roleplaying Game of Actions and Consequences**<br/>
*Writing, Design and Layout, December 2008*
    * A tabletop roleplaying game designed to run any number of genres or settings. It is 
    meant to be quick and easy, while supporting a variety of styles of play. This system 
    was later revised, improved and use in both *Against the Dark Yogi* and *Shadows Over Sol*.
    
* **Dark Ages: Trystell**<br/>
*Writing, Design and System Administration, July 2002*
    * A browser-based strategy game, where players take on the role of empires in a 
    fantasy world. The game was competitive and would pit players against each other for 
    domination over the continent. At its height it has over 1000 active players.

    functionality within the proxied Jupyter Notebook instances.

* **GenePattern Server** <br/>
*[http://genepattern.org](http://genepattern.org)*
    * A platform for bioinformatic research that wraps hundreds of analytic tools for the 
    analysis of gene expression (RNA-seq and microarray), sequence variation and copy 
    number, proteomic, flow cytometry and network analysis. It also provides a REST API 
    and queueing system integrations.

* **GenePattern Python Library** <br/>
*[https://github.com/genepattern/genepattern-python](https://github.com/genepattern/genepattern-python)*
    * A Python wrapper for the GenePattern API. It provides programmatic access for 
    searching and selecting analysess, uploading files, submitting jobs, retrieving the 
    analysis results and sending those results to a downstream step in an analysis 
    pipeline.

* **Jupyter WYSIWYG Editor** <br/>
*[https://github.com/genepattern/jupyter-wysiwyg](https://github.com/genepattern/jupyter-wysiwyg)* 
    * A extension for Jupyter Notebook that adds WYSIWYG editing functionality to 
    markdown/HTML cells. It does this by integrating the popular CKEditor.

* **GenomeSpace** <br/>
*[http://genomespace.org](http://genomespace.org)* 
    * A cloud-based interoperability framework, bridging the gaps between a diverse set of 
    popular bioinformatic tools. This makes it possible to frictionlessly use the 
    available analyses and visualizations in each tool with others in the GenomeSpace 
    ecosystem.

* **IGV.js Jupyter** <br/>
*[https://github.com/igvteam/igv.js-jupyter](https://github.com/igvteam/igv.js-jupyter)* 
    * A Python wrapper and nbextension for the JavaScript version of Integrative Genomics 
    Viewer (IGV.js), allowing the popular genomic visualization tool to be easily 
    configured and embedded inside the Jupyter Notebook environment.

* **Django Simple Ticket** <br/>
*[https://github.com/tmtabor/django-simpleticket](https://github.com/tmtabor/django-simpleticket)* 
    * A simple ticket-tracking app that can easily be dropped into a new or existing
